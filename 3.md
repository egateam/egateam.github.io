# Part A: Online Data Analysis Platform

Online data analysis platform is constructed for pairwise/multiple alignments with genomes smaller than 30M. We provide user-friendly interfaces and detailed instructions. Users can visit online EGA site at http://ega.nju.edu.cn.

This image shows a screen snapshot of our website home page. The name of our application is Easy Genome Aligner. Menu bars on the top show the main buttons, going from left to right as: Home, Upload, Align, Process, Contact, Tutorial. At the top right-hand corner shows two links for you to log in or register a new ID. 

You can either register a new ID or log in through the public ID with the username "guest" and password "password".

Two major functions of our application are multiple genome alignment and paralog detection via self-alignment. You could click on the “view details” button for more information. Following are three example descriptions to help users get a quick start.
