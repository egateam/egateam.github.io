# Introduction

Multiple genome alignments play a fundamental role in many biological realms such as evolution and genomics. Easy Genome Aligner (EGA) is an integrated application designed to make complicated whole genome multiple alignments really accessible for most biologists.


Two major functions of EGA are multiple genome alignment for construction of phylogenetic relationship and self-alignment for paralogous detection. The tools are available through both a web-based graphical interface and a local operating virtual machine.

To meet different needs, the application is available through both an online data analysis platform with a friendly user interface to deal with operations of smaller-scale sequence data, and a full functional virtual machine.
