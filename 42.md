# Notice

Before you start to implement, there are several things to Notice here.
1. The virtual machine could apply to windows7/windows8/windows10 systems, but it can only be deployable in a 64bit environment. If you are an apple system user, make sure your system have been upgraded to mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 or above.
2.	The configuration of virtual machine needs at least 4 GB of memory, 1 CPU quad core or dual-core CPUs with hyper-threading enabled. Users can change settings in the settings panel after installation.
3.	Try to use the recommended version of software.
4.	Some System security software might conflict with virtual machine, so please exit them before using local EGA service.
