# For multiple genomes alignment


The result folder contains folders listed below:
	1. Genomes: Contains the information of individual files processed in this alignment, including: .fasta file after data preparation, information after repeat mask and the size analysis of the genome.
	2. Pairwise: Contains the results of pairwise alignment between reference genome and every other genomes in this alignment.
	3. jobID*_mz: Combine the individual result file of pairwise alignment into .maf file by Multiz. 
	4. jobID_fasta: Convert .maf file produced in the former step into .fasta file.
	5. jobID_refined: The .fasta file in the former step may contain gaps. After refinement, the final result of alignment is stored in the refined .fasta file. 
	6. jobID_vcf: Contains a .vcf file stored with the statistical analysis of SNP and indel information in the alignment results.
	7. jobID_phylo: Contains the result files related to the phylogenetic tree, including: the final phylogenetic tree in .nwk and .phy file style, a vector graphic in .svg file style and other intermediate files produced during the construction process by RAxML. 
######*jobID refers to the parameter you set for the name of the alignment.
